# Weather Image Classification for CCTV Road images

A deep learning project for classifying weather conditions from images using ResNet and Vision Transformer (ViT) models.

## Overview

This project implements a weather classification system that can identify four different weather conditions:
- **Clear** - Clear skies
- **Rain** - Rainy conditions  
- **Fog** - Foggy weather
- **Snow** - Snowy conditions

The system uses state-of-the-art deep learning models including ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer (ViT) for accurate weather classification.

## Features

### 🔬 Data Processing
- **Automated dataset scanning** with image validation
- **Balanced dataset creation** with stratified sampling
- **Train/validation/test splits** (70%/15%/15%)
- **Data augmentation** for underrepresented classes
- **Class distribution visualization**

### 🤖 Model Architectures
- **ResNet-50** with TensorFlow Hub integration
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)** for state-of-the-art performance
- **Transfer learning** from pre-trained models
- **Custom training pipelines** for each architecture

### 📊 Evaluation & Metrics
- **Comprehensive evaluation metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **ROC curves** with AUC scores for each class
- **Confusion matrices** for detailed performance analysis
- **Training history visualization**
- **Per-class performance breakdown**

 **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies
- `tensorflow-macos` & `tensorflow-metal` (for Apple Silicon Macs)
- `tensorflow-hub` (for pre-trained models)
- `torch` & `torchvision` (PyTorch support)
- `transformers` (Hugging Face transformers)
- `scikit-learn` (evaluation metrics)
- `matplotlib` (visualizations)
- `pillow` (image processing)
- `pandas` (data manipulation)
- `optuna` (hyperparameter optimization)

## Usage

### 1. Data Preprocessing

Prepare your dataset and create balanced splits:

```bash
python weather_preprocessing.py
```

This script will:
- Scan all weather category folders for valid images
- Create balanced train/validation/test splits
- Generate dataset distribution visualization
- Save splits to CSV files in the `splits/` directory

### 2. Data Augmentation

Enhance your training data with augmentation:

```bash
python augment_images.py
```

Features include:
- Horizontal flipping
- Brightness adjustments
- Hue shifting
- Targeted augmentation for underrepresented classes

### 3. Model Evaluation

Evaluate the trained ResNet model:

```bash
python evaluate_resnet.py
```

Or run comprehensive testing on both models:

```bash
python test_models.py
```

### 4. Dataset Analysis

View dataset distribution:

```bash
python show_distribution.py
```
